# About ReFi Mediterranean

ReFi Mediterranean is a bioregional coordination node advancing regenerative finance across the Mediterranean region. We connect local regenerators and Web3 public goods communities, experimenting with impact-driven funding mechanisms to support real-world ecological, social, and economic impact.

## What We Are

ReFi Mediterranean serves as a coordination hub for ReFi nodes and regenerative initiatives across the Mediterranean bioregion. We operate at the intersection of:

- **Local regeneration**: Supporting land-based projects and communities with proven local impact
- **Web3 public goods**: Connecting regenerative movements with global innovations in finance, technology, and governance
- **Impact-driven funding**: Experimenting with mechanisms like ImpactQF that reward demonstrated results, not just proposals

## Bioregional Framing

The Mediterranean bioregion encompasses diverse ecosystems, cultures, and economies connected by shared geography, climate, and challenges. Our work recognizes that regenerative solutions must be:

- **Place-based**: Rooted in local knowledge, needs, and contexts
- **Networked**: Connected to global movements and resources
- **Scalable**: Replicable patterns that can spread across the region

## How We Work

### Funding Mechanisms

We run bioregional funding rounds using innovative mechanisms like **ImpactQF** (Tunable Quadratic Funding), which combines:

- **Retrospective evaluation**: Assessing past activities and outputs, not just future plans
- **Community input**: Quadratic Funding amplifies broad community support
- **Impact scoring**: Evaluation scores influence how matching funds are distributed

### Impact Reporting

We prioritize transparency and accountability through standardized impact reporting:

- **Karma GAP integration**: Projects report activities and outputs using structured frameworks
- **Verifiable data**: Impact claims are backed by documented evidence
- **Public evaluation**: Evaluation processes and results are transparent

### Ecosystem Building

We convene and connect:

- **Local nodes**: ReFi DAO Local Nodes and GreenPill Chapters across the Mediterranean
- **Land-based projects**: Regenerative agriculture, restoration, and community initiatives
- **Partner networks**: Aligned organizations working on complementary goals

## Our Values

- **Transparency**: Open documentation, decision-making, and impact reporting
- **Accountability**: Verifiable claims backed by evidence and evaluation
- **Impact-driven**: Funding rewards demonstrated results, not just proposals
- **Bioregional**: Solutions grounded in local contexts while connected globally
- **Collaboration**: Building shared capacity through partnerships and networks

## Our Team

ReFi Mediterranean is stewarded by practitioners with deep experience in regenerative finance, Web3 public goods, and bioregional coordination.
