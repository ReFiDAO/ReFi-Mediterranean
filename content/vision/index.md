# Vision

## Our Mission

ReFi Mediterranean connects regenerative finance initiatives across the Mediterranean region, supporting projects that leverage Web3 for real-world impact and address local needs. Our work focuses on:

- **Bioregional approaches** to financing regenerative initiatives
- **Local impact** supporting projects across Mediterranean countries
- **Community coordination** connecting local initiatives with global ReFi networks
- **Transparency** through open documentation and decision-making processes

## What We Want to Achieve

We envision a Mediterranean bioregion where:

- **Regenerative projects thrive**: Local initiatives have access to funding mechanisms that reward demonstrated impact
- **Web3 tools serve regeneration**: Technology amplifies rather than replaces local knowledge and practices
- **Networks strengthen**: Connections between local nodes, projects, and global movements create shared capacity
- **Impact is visible**: Transparent reporting and evaluation build trust and enable learning

## Our Values

### Transparency

We believe in open documentation, decision-making, and impact reporting. Our processes, evaluations, and results are public and verifiable.

### Accountability

Claims must be backed by evidence. We use standardized frameworks like Karma GAP to ensure impact reporting is structured, verifiable, and comparable.

### Impact-Driven

Funding rewards demonstrated results, not just well-written proposals. We experiment with mechanisms like ImpactQF that balance community input with rigorous evaluation.

### Bioregional

Solutions are grounded in local contexts—understanding place-specific needs, knowledge, and challenges—while remaining connected to global movements and resources.

### Collaboration

We build shared capacity through partnerships and networks. No single organization can regenerate the Mediterranean alone.

## Our Approach

### Experimentation

We test new funding mechanisms and evaluation frameworks, learning from what works and what doesn't.

### Connection

We convene local nodes, land-based projects, and partner networks, creating spaces for collaboration and knowledge sharing.

### Support

We help projects integrate Web3/ReFi tools where they support mission, not replace local practices.

### Communication

We share learnings, opportunities, and impact with donors, communities, and the broader ReFi ecosystem.
