# Initiatives

ReFi Mediterranean runs funding rounds and supports initiatives that advance regenerative finance across the Mediterranean bioregion. Our initiatives experiment with innovative funding mechanisms and evaluation frameworks.

## Past Initiatives

### GG23 ImpactQF Round (April 2025)

**The first bioregional-scale Quadratic Funding round supporting regenerative projects across the Mediterranean region.**

In partnership with [Regen Coordination](https://www.regencoordination.xyz/regen-coordination-global-gg23), we implemented **ImpactQF** – a Tunable Quadratic Funding model that combines retrospective impact evaluation with Quadratic Funding.

#### Key Details

- **Matching Pool**: $10,000 USDGLO
  - $1,000 from Ma Earth
  - $5,000 from Kevin Owocki
  - $3,000 from Celo Public Goods
  - $1,000 from ReFi Med Treasury
- **Donation Window**: April 2 @ noon UTC → April 16 @ 23:59 UTC
- **Results Announced**: April 23, 2025
- **Round Operators**: [Regen Avocado](https://x.com/regenavocado) and [Luiz Fernando](https://x.com/louizfe)

#### What is ImpactQF?

ImpactQF combines:

1. **Impact Evaluation**: Review and evaluation of previously completed activities, outputs, and impact claims (retrospective, not just forward-looking proposals)
2. **Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF)**: Impact evaluation scores feed into the QF matching algorithm, adjusting how funds are distributed

This hybrid approach leverages:
- ✅ QF's decentralized, community-driven funding allocation and crowdfunding
- ✅ Retrospective evaluation of contributions and impact, ensuring results-driven funding

#### Why ImpactQF?

We experimented with ImpactQF to:

- **Ensure funds reward impact**: Projects receive funding based on results, not just well-written grant applications or social capital
- **Reduce inefficiencies in traditional QF**: Standard QF can be gamed by influencer-driven popularity; ImpactQF balances community input with robust evaluation
- **Strengthen transparency and trust**: Karma GAP impact reports provide verifiable data, increasing accountability and legitimacy in ReFi grantmaking

#### Eligibility

Projects were required to:

- Complete Activities & Outputs reporting in Karma GAP before the application deadline
- Be either:
  1. Established Web3/ReFi nodes in the Mediterranean bioregion (ReFi DAO Local Nodes, GreenPill Chapters, Regen Coordination partner networks)
  2. Local regenerators in the Mediterranean bioregion (land-based regenerative projects, communities with proven local impact, projects ready to integrate ReFi tools)

## Current Initiatives

### Bioregional Reforestation Round

*Details coming soon.*

ReFi Mediterranean is partnering with Silvi and other bioregional partners on a reforestation funding round supporting regenerative forestry initiatives across the Mediterranean.
