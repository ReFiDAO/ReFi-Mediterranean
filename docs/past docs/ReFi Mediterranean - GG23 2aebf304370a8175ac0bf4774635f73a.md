# 🌍 **ReFi Mediterranean** GG23 **Round**

## **1️⃣ About This Round**

The **ReFi Mediterranean** round is the first localized Quadratic Funding round at bioregional scale. In partnership with Regen Coordination and following the [GG22 BioFi Pathfinders Round](https://gap.karmahq.xyz/community/regen-coordination?programId=18), this innovative impact-driven funding round supports regenerative finance (ReFi) projects that have demonstrated meaningful contributions within the Mediterranean ecosystem.

This round brings together ReFi DAO and ReFi Mediterranean nodes to support a network of local projects leveraging Web3 for real-world impact and addressing local needs. We're implementing **ImpactQF** – a [Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF)](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/expertise-and-quadratic-funding-bd4f0c5c3e23) model that combines retrospective impact evaluation with Quadratic Funding (QF).

🔹 **Round Operators:**

- [**Regen Avocado**](https://x.com/regenavocado): Founder Rifai Sicilia, Member ReFi Italia, Steward ReFi Mediterranean, Contributor to Community Success @ Karma
- [**Luiz Fernando**](https://x.com/louizfe): Founder & Lead of ReFi Barcelona, Core Steward & Operations Lead at ReFi DAO.

🔹 **Donation Dates:** April 2nd @ noon UTC → April 16th @ 23:59 UTC

🔹 **Total Matching Pool:** $10,000 USDGLO

- $1K Ma Earth
- $5k Kevin Owocki
- $3K Celo Public Goods
- $1K ReFi Med Treasury

## **2️⃣ Who We’re Funding**

The ReFi Mediterranean round aims to support projects creating ecological, social, and economic impact across the Mediterranean bioregion.

✅ **Eligibility Requirements:**

- All projects **must** complete Activities & Outputs reporting in Karma GAP before the application deadline
    - Projects must have active goals or plans for the current year
    - Projects must demonstrate clear impact and implementation of standardized reporting
- Be either:
    1. **Established Web3/ReFi nodes in the Mediterranean bioregion (may or may not already be part of ReFi Mediterranean):**
        - ReFi DAO Local Nodes and GreenPill Chapters
        - Projects from Regen Coordination partner networks
        - Current Web3 regenerative initiatives
    2. **Local regenerators in the Mediterranean bioregion (mainly not yet connected to ReFi/Web3):**
        - Land-based regenerative projects in Mediterranean
        - Communities with proven local impact
        - Projects ready to integrate ReFi tools

## **3️⃣ Funding Mechanism**

For this round, we're implementing [**ImpactQF**](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/citizen-grants-gcp-impact-passports-and-impact-quadratic-funding-impactqf/19712), alongside [Regen Coordination](https://www.regencoordination.xyz/regen-coordination-global-gg23), – a new approach that rewards demonstrated impact.

**What is ImpactQF?** Our planned implementation combines:

1. **Impact Evaluation** – A review and evaluation of previously completed activities, outputs and impact claims, rather than just forward-looking project proposals.
2. **Tunable Quadratic Funding (TQF)** – A mechanism that enables impact evaluation scores to feed into the QF matching algorithm, adjusting how funds are distributed.

This hybrid approach aims to leverage the strengths of both models:

✅ QF’s decentralized, community-driven funding allocation and crowdfunding

✅ Retrospective evaluation of contributions and impact, ensuring results-driven funding

**What is Quadratic Funding (QF)?**

Quadratic Funding (QF) is a crowd-funding mechanism that amplifies available resources by inviting community members to make donations (big or small) that act as votes on where to allocate funds. The broader the support, the bigger the match!

**Why ImpactQF?**

We are using **ImpactQF** because we aim to experiment with a new mechanism with potential to:

- **Ensure funds reward impact** – Projects receive funding based on results, not just well-written grant applications or social capital.
- **Reduce inefficiencies in traditional QF** – Standard QF can be gamed by influencer-driven popularity; ImpactQF aims to balance community input with robust evaluation.
- **Strengthen transparency and trust** – Karma GAP impact reports provide verifiable data, increasing accountability and legitimacy in ReFi grantmaking.

### **Apply to the round here [https://builder.gitcoin.co/#/chains/42220/rounds/33](https://builder.gitcoin.co/#/chains/42220/rounds/33)**

### 🔍 **Evaluation Process:**

1. **Reporting via Karma GAP**
    - Your activities and outputs in Karma GAP provide structured, verifiable data on your contributions
    - This is REQUIRED for all participants and will directly affect your funding
2. **Evaluation by the Coordination Council**
    - The Council assesses contribution reports based on predefined criteria
    - This generates an Impact Score reflecting effectiveness and alignment with ReFi Mediterranean goals
3. **Impact Scores Feed into QF Algorithm**
    - Your Impact Score influences how matching funds are allocated
    - Projects with higher impact scores receive proportionally more matching funds

### 🤝 **For Donors:**

🔹 **How to Donate:**

- Visit Gitcoin during April 2–16
- Choose your favorite projects within the ReFi Mediterranean Round
- Even $1 helps a lot—thanks to QF, small contributions go a long way!
